summary: Sometimes when a user wishes to remove themselves from your application, you will want to permanently delete his/her user account.

The following sample shows how you can delete a user:

```objc
NSError *error;

KiiUser *user = [KiiUser currentUser];
[user deleteSynchronous:&error];

if(error != nil) {
    // User deletion failed
    // Please check error description/code to see what went wrong...
}
```
