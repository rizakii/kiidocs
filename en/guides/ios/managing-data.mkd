Based on your application's requirements, you may wish to utilize one or both of these.sort-priority: 30page-id: ios-managing_data-en---* **Object Storage**: For storing arbitrary key/value pairs as JSON-style  objects. You can freely define your objects by adding any key-value pairs  without setting any schemas or doing any extra customization.* **File Storage**: For storing any files, such as images and movies. Not only  you can upload/download files, but also you can publish the file by URL or  put it in the trash (i.e., a temporal place where deleted files are stored in  Kii Cloud; later users can restore any files they've mistakenly deleted).
