You can permanently delete a file by invoking the `shredFile`
method.  The file will be permanently deleted; you cannot restore the file.

```objc
KiiFile *file = [KiiFile fileWithURI:@"_URI_OF_THE_FILE_"];
NSError *error;

// Shred the file
[file ShredFileSynchronous:&error];

if (error != nil) {
  // Moving file to trash failed
  // Please check error description/code to see what went wrong...
}
```

**Please Note:** The file will be deleted from the server immediately when
invoking the `shredFile` method - you do not need to invoke the
`saveFile` method.
