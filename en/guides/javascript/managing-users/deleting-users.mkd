The following sample shows how you can delete a user:

```javascript
var user = KiiUser.getCurrentUser();
user.delete({
  // Called on successful deletion
  success: function(theUser) {
    console.log("User deleted!");
  },
  failure: function(theUser, errorString) {
    console.log("Error deleting user: " + errorString);
  }
});
```
