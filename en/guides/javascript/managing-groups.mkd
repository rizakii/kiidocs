Kii SDK provides a way to manage groups of users; whether it's for sharing pictures or for group chatting, you can leverage this functionality to easily create fun, social applications.

Once a group is defined, you can use this as a unit of access control (e.g., allowing only a group member to read a file).

Any authenticated users can create a group.  Once created, the group owner has the ability to add and remove members in the group by default.
