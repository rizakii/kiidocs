You can delete an object by invoking delete API:

```sh
curl -v -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "x-kii-appid:{APP_ID}" \
  -H "x-kii-appkey:{APP_KEY}" \
  -H "If-Match:1" \
  "https://api.kii.com/api/apps/{APP_ID}/users/me/buckets/{BUCKET_NAME}/objects/{OBJECT_ID}"
```

Kii Cloud will respond with a 204 response if the object has been successfully deleted.
