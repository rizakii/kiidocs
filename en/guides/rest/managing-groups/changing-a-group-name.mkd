A group owner can change a name of the existing group as shown:

```sh
curl -v -X PUT \
    -H "content-type: text/plain" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"
    -H "x-kii-appid: APP_ID} \
    -H "x-kii-appkey:{APP_KEY} \
    -d "New name" \
    "https://api.kii.com/api/apps/{APP_ID}/groups/{GROUP_ID}/name"
```

Kii Cloud will return a 200 response if the rename is successful.
