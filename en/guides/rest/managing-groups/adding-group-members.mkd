A group owner can add additional members in the group as shown below:

```sh
curl -v -X PUT \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
    -H "x-kii-appid:s{APP_ID}" \
    -H "x-kii-appkey:{APP_KEY}" \
    "https://api.kii.com/api/apps/{APP_ID}/groups/{GROUP_ID}/members/{USER_ID}"
```

Kii Cloud will return a 200 (already a member) or 201 (added as a new member) response based on the result.
